    "[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/) is a petabyte-scale analytics data warehouse that you can use to run SQL queries over vast amounts of data in near real time.\n",

You can use visualization tools to help you identify trends, respond to them, and make predictions using your data. In this tutorial, you use the BigQuery Python client library and pandas in a Jupyter notebook to visualize data.\n",

Behind the scenes, `%%bigquery` uses the BigQuery Python client library to run the given query, convert the results to a pandas `Dataframe`, optionally save the results to a variable, and finally display the results. Using the BigQuery Python client library directly instead of through magic commands gives you more control over your queries and allows for more complex configurations. The library's integrations with pandas enable you to combine the power of declarative SQL with imperative code (Python) to perform interesting data analysis, visualization, and transformation tasks.\n",
